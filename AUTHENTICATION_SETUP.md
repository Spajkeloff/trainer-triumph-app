### 🚀 Getting Started

#### 1. **Test the Authentication System**
1. Visit `/auth` to access the login/signup page
2. Create a new account with different roles
3. Test the password reset functionality
4. Verify email confirmation works

#### 2. **Configure Email Service (Optional)**
For custom email templates, set up Resend:

1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Verify your domain at [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
3. Get your API key from [Resend API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
4. Add the RESEND_API_KEY to your Supabase secrets

```bash
# The edge function is already created at:
# supabase/functions/send-auth-email/index.ts
```

#### 3. **Supabase Configuration**
Your Supabase project is already configured with:
- ✅ User profiles table with role management
- ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ✅ Database triggers for user creation
- ✅ Email confirmation settings

**Recommended Settings:**
- Go to [Supabase Auth Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qyytmkvyjbpserxfmsxa/auth/settings)
- For development: Disable "Confirm email" for faster testing
- For production: Keep email confirmation enabled
